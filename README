A clean, production-aware implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system  
that allows users to **chat with their own documents**.

## ✨ Overview

Large Language Models are powerful but can hallucinate when they lack context.  
This project solves that problem using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

Users upload documents, and the system retrieves the most relevant content  
before generating responses — ensuring **accurate, grounded answers**.

## ▶️ Getting Started

1️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Run the Application
streamlit run RAG_app.py

3️⃣ Use the Chatbot

1. Enter your OpenAI API key

2. Upload one or more documents

3. Create the vector store

4. Ask questions about your data

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

API keys are entered at runtime and never stored

Vector databases are generated dynamically

.env, temporary files, and vector stores are excluded from Git

No pre-built embeddings are committed

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

Focus on core RAG concepts, not demo overload

One LLM provider for clarity and explainability

Simple retriever strategy for reliability

Code that is easy to explain and defend in interviews

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:

Practical understanding of Retrieval-Augmented Generation

How vector search grounds LLM responses

Trade-offs in chunk size and retrieval depth

Conversational memory management

Building real-world LLM applications responsibly

## 📝 Note on Authorship

This project is inspired by publicly available RAG examples and official documentation.
The implementation has been refactored, simplified, and structured to clearly demonstrate
understanding of RAG fundamentals and production-aware design.
